* Wipers play a vitial role in three and four wheelers.It is proven very helpful in rainy,dusty or in mist weather.Driver just have to turn on the wiper button and adjust the speed according to his convenience in order to have a sense of confidence and to have a clear view of the road.In this project I have used STM32F4xx-discovery board to simulate it where we have considered leds as wiper.I have shown speed of the wiper by how fast the led is blinking

* A wiper is a vital component that removes rainfall or any other liquid from the windscreen of a vehicle. The previous method needed manual wiper activation, and raising the wiper was a tough task. As a result, this strategy is suggested as a solution to these problems. The project's purpose is to provide automatic transmission to older cars in order to enhance their systems.
